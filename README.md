    <p> My Journey, My Dream

Hi, I’m Nuhami Daniel, and this is my story.

I was born on a beautiful November 12 morning in 2007, surrounded by love from my parents, Daniel Kebade and Mery Gelana. Growing up with my sister, Frehiwot, and my brother, Dagim, my childhood was filled with laughter, learning, and dreams.

I started my education at Bole Addis for KG, then moved to Deborah School for elementary, and now I’m a grade 11 student at Edget Chora Secondary School. Through all these years, one thing has remained constant—my passion for learning and my dream to become a lawyer. I’ve always wanted to help my country, to stand for what’s right, and to make a real difference in people’s lives. But that’s not all—I also dream of becoming a successful businesswoman. I want to create opportunities, build something meaningful, and inspire others to chase their dreams.

Beyond my studies, I love listening to music, reading books, and cooking. There’s something special about creating a meal from scratch, just like how I’m building my future step by step. And nothing makes me happier than spending holidays with my family and friends, sharing laughter and love.

Every day, I work hard to get closer to my goals. I believe that with dedication, passion, and the support of the people I love, I can turn my dreams into reality. This is just the beginning of my journey, and I can’t wait to see where it takes me.
